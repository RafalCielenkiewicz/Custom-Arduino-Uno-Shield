## Project Description  

This project focuses on designing a custom shield for the Arduino Uno to expand its functionality. The shield includes a USB-C port, temperature sensors, an STM32 microcontroller, voltage regulators, touch switches and galvanic isolation.  

The goal was to create a versatile shield for various applications, selecting components based on price, availability and delivery time.  

## Features  

- **USB-C Port** – Provides power and communication.  
- **Temperature Sensors** – Monitors the surrounding environment.  
- **STM32 Microcontroller** – Handles sensor data and controls other components.  
- **Voltage Regulators** – Ensures a stable power supply.  
- **Touch Switches** – Enables user interaction.  
- **Galvanic Isolation** – Protects against voltage spikes.  

## Component Selection  

- **Microcontroller:** STM32C031C4T6 (16 kB Flash, 12 kB RAM, 45 I/O, I2C interface)  
- **Temperature Sensor:** TMP1826NGRR (+/-0.2°C accuracy, -55°C to +150°C range)  
- **Voltage Regulator:** LD1117V33 (3.3V output, max 0.8A)  
- **Tactile Switch:** 506-1571220-1 (50 mA, 24V DC)  
- **Galvanic Isolation:** ISO1540DR (3V-5.5V supply, 70 ns delay)  

The STM32 was chosen over STM8 due to better features at the same price and its ease of programming, which will be useful in future projects. 


### PCB Design  
The shield was designed using Altium.
