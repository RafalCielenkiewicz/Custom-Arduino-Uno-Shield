Design and development of a board for Arduino Leonardo in
Altium Designer software. The board includes a 32-bit microprocessor,
5V power supply and galvanic isolation. In addition, I equipped it with
with a temperature sensor, input/output ports, LEDs and buttons
reset. The entire process, from designing to soldering the components,
was carried out personally. This experience developed my
PCB design and development skills.
